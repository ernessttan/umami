# Umami
Umami is a social network application that allows users to post food content, save recipes, and automatically create shopping lists from their recipes. The idea for Umami came to me when I was scrolling through Instagram/Tiktok for recipes. I noticed that these apps lack the features of a traditional recipe app as it was hard to share and save recipes. However, traditional recipe apps lack the features of a social media app. So I thought to myself: why not have the best of both worlds?
